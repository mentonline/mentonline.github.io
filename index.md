# Welcome Mentor Online

Mentonline provides a platform to bring teachers and students together. We are currently onboarding students and teachers, and building our course catalog. 

We will be starting soon. 

Our aim is to...
1. Provide teachers an opportunity to teach what they are passionate about and earn from the comfort of their home.
2. Provide opportunities to parents to help their kids learn exciting new things and engage them meaningfully at home.

*Teachers...* have you always dreamt of being a teacher some day or have a unique skill that a lot of people would love to learn from you? Or may be you already teach kids around and looking to reach more kids. You can now teach right from the comfort of your home. Be it Drawing, Storytelling, Art, Math, or just about anything you are passionate about! We are currently building our course catalogue for our Home Coaching platform MentOnline where we find students who'd love to learn from you.

*Parents...* do you want to help your kids learn a variety of skills/subjects right from the comfort of home, and at the same time engage them meaningfully? At MentOnline, we will have a variety of courses like Drawing, Pencil Sketching, Canvas Painting, Storytelling, Public Speaking, and a lot more. And, we are just getting started. We will update you via Email/WhatsApp as and when we have more courses in our catalogue, or you can check our website later.
